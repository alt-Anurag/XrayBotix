## 🎯 Problem Identified

Traditional X-ray analysis faces several critical challenges:

- **Time-consuming manual interpretation**: Radiologists require extensive time to analyze and report findings.
- **Human error susceptibility**: Fatigue and oversight can lead to missed diagnoses or misinterpretations.
- **Limited accessibility**: Shortage of qualified radiologists, especially in remote areas.
- **Inconsistent accuracy**: Diagnostic accuracy varies based on practitioner experience and expertise.
- **Delayed diagnosis**: Extended waiting times for radiology reports can delay critical treatment decisions.
- **High costs**: Manual analysis requires expensive specialist consultations.
- **Scalability issues**: Growing demand for medical imaging services exceeds available human resources.

These challenges result in delayed patient care, increased healthcare costs, and potential missed diagnoses that could be life-threatening.
